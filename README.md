# vaioscrape
Capture from esupport.sony.com their metadata and driver installation files, as they're ending support in March.
Scraping is done with requests & beautifulsoup. Downloads are calls to wget from python.

## Python Module Dependencies
  * bs4
  * requests
  * lxml
  * json

## vaio.py
Per model python class for scraping the driver files and metadata; such as title, description, size, os, etc.
Appends unique entries per model to ./filelist.txt
Writes <modelname>.json to ./metadata/
## vaiomodels.py
Scrapes for a complete model list of desktop and laptop Vaio products
Writes to ./desktops.json and ./laptops.json
## readjson.py
Example for reading back the json data into python
Can be called from the shell with '<modelname>' to print its metadata to STDOUT read from ./metadata/<modelname>.json
Or tinker with the code to do stuff with reloaded python dictionaries
Note that '/' symbols in model name get converted to underscore '_' but either works for the script in the shell arg input
## run.py
Example grab-all script using the above mentioned scripts along with wget called from python. Logic is very dumb and you may end up with 30+ simultaneous downloads.
## one.py
Example option to input one model in as a shell arg and download its meta data and drivers. Probably a better option to use than run.py, for there are better ways to do parallel downloads. It also will build upon filelist.txt as you use it.

Pathway to the firehose of data:
Run at your own risk! No guarantees of best practices, best conventions, or safety to your system and network resources.
Setup was done in a debian based distro (ubuntu or raspbian would work).
virtualenv is a python environment re-direct so that python module installs don't override what's available to your normal OS env.
pip is like "apt-get" for python

## Setup
```
sudo apt install -y python python-pip virtualenv wget screen
cd ~/my_massive_storage_space
tar -xvf sonyvaiodrivers.tar
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install bs4 requests lxml
./run.py
```

In another window monitor downloads with: `tail -f ./vaiodownload.log`
